# START HERE — SEO Prompt Master

> **You are an AI assistant. This file activates an autonomous, step-by-step SEO audit-and-fix workflow for the project in your current working directory.** Follow it exactly. Do not skip steps. Do not ask permission to begin — begin.

You have been given a knowledge base (`docs/01`–`docs/17`), industry-specific overlays (`verticals/` — optional, additive), a set of step prompts (`prompts/`), checklists (`checklists/`), output templates (`templates/`), and **two runnable tools** (`tools/`). Your job is to bring **every public page** of the host project into full compliance with Google's official SEO guidance, one page at a time, leaving nothing out.

## Run the tool early, not at the end

```bash
node tools/seo-audit.mjs --url https://the-site.example --max 40 --md seo-report.md
```

Zero dependencies, Node 18+. Works against a local build (`--url http://localhost:3000`) when there is no live site.

Do this in **Phase 0**, before you have read a single route file. Reading the repository tells you what the project *intends*. The tool tells you what the server *returns*, and it sees three classes of problem that source review structurally cannot: a template that answers 200 for URLs that do not exist, an hreflang set that is one-way (which discards the entire cluster, not just that pair), and metadata that a framework streams past `</head>`. Its findings give Phase 2 a head start and its score gives you the baseline you will later prove you improved.

`tools/seo-smoke.sh` is the other half — the ten-second check you wire into the deploy so none of this regresses next month. See `tools/README.md` for both.

What the tools **cannot** see, and therefore what stays yours: content quality (`docs/14`), off-page authority (`docs/17`), and real field Core Web Vitals (`docs/05` — those come from CrUX).

---

## Ground rules (read once, obey always)

1. **The `docs/` folder is your source of truth.** Every recommendation you make must trace to a rule in `docs/01`–`docs/17`. When you cite a reason, cite the doc section (e.g. "docs/13 §soft 404"). Docs 01–11 cover the page itself; 12–17 cover crawling, indexing, quality, measurement, migrations and off-page.
2. **Never break the build.** After any change, run the project's typecheck/lint/build. If it fails, fix it before moving on.
3. **Never invent facts about Google.** If a claim isn't in `docs/`, say "not covered by the knowledge base" rather than guessing.
4. **Work page by page. Persist your progress to a file** so nothing is forgotten across long runs (`SEO-AUDIT-PROGRESS.md`).
5. **Evidence over assertion.** Do not claim a page is "fixed" until you have verified the change (grep the rendered output, run the build, or load the route).
6. **Respect intent.** A page being *technically reachable* is not the same as it *should be indexed*. Distinguish: **public+indexable**, **public-but-noindex** (tools, search results, auth flows), and **private** (dashboards, admin).

## Autonomy contract (read this if you're tempted to stop and ask)

**Do not pause between phases, between pages, or mid-backlog to ask "should I continue?"** You already have everything you need — the goal, the rules, the phase order, and the definition of done. Move directly from one phase, one page, one backlog item to the next without a check-in. A long site with hundreds of routes is not a reason to stop and summarize progress and wait — it's a reason to keep working through them.

**The only legitimate reasons to stop before "done" are:**
- You genuinely cannot access the repository, run the build, or determine the stack (Phase 0 blocked).
- A finding requires a real business decision this repo can't make for you (e.g. "should `/internal-tool` be public at all" is a product call, not an SEO one) — ask that one specific question, then keep going on everything else while you wait.
- You are resuming a session and `ROUTES-INVENTORY.md`/`SEO-AUDIT-PROGRESS.md` already exist — read them, pick up exactly where they left off, and say so in one line, then continue without re-litigating already-decided items.

**Everything else — "there are a lot of pages," "this will take many tool calls," "I should check in before Phase 4" — is not a stopping condition.** If your environment requires per-action approval for file edits or shell commands, that's a setting outside this workflow's control; this document's instructions are to proceed continuously regardless.

## The Workflow (5 phases + 1 optional)

Execute these in order. Each phase has a dedicated prompt file with the full instructions — open it and follow it.

### Phase 0 — Bootstrap & detect  → `prompts/00-bootstrap.md`
Detect the framework (Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit, Astro, Remix, Rails, Django, Laravel, plain HTML, etc.), the routing convention, the i18n setup, and where metadata/sitemaps/robots live. Read the whole `docs/` folder into your working memory, and check `verticals/README.md` for a matching industry overlay (e-commerce, SaaS, marketplace, Discord bot, Minecraft server list, etc.). **Run `tools/seo-audit.mjs` against the live site or a local build** and keep its report beside you for the rest of the run. Produce a short **Stack Report**.

### Phase 1 — Discover routes  → `prompts/01-discover-routes.md`
Enumerate **every route** in the project. Classify each as:
- `public-index` — should be crawlable & indexable
- `public-noindex` — reachable but must be `noindex` (internal search results, live tools, auth screens, thank-you pages)
- `private` — must be blocked (dashboards, admin, account, API)

Also flag **routes that SHOULD be public but currently aren't** (e.g. a feature page hidden behind an unnecessary `noindex` or `robots.txt Disallow`).
Write the result to **`ROUTES-INVENTORY.md`** using `templates/routes-inventory.md`.

### Phase 2 — Audit each public page  → `prompts/02-audit-page.md`
For **every** `public-index` route, run the 9-point audit (metadata, canonical/hreflang, robots, JSON-LD, headings/semantics, images, internal links, rendering, sitemap). Record findings per page in **`SEO-AUDIT-PROGRESS.md`** using `templates/audit-progress.md`. Do not stop until every page has a row.

### Phase 3 — Prioritize  → `prompts/03-prioritize-fixes.md`
Turn the findings into a single prioritized backlog: **P1 (indexing/crawl blockers)**, **P2 (structured data / render / dedup)**, **P3 (hygiene / CWV polish)**. Note any deliberate skips with a reason tied to `docs/`. Self-recheck a sample of Phase 2's passes, then compute a baseline **SEO Score** and **GEO Score** out of 100 (`docs/11`).

### Phase 4 — Fix & verify  → `prompts/04-apply-and-verify.md`
Work the backlog top-down. Fix **shared infrastructure first** (metadata helper, sitemap, robots, i18n) because it fixes many pages at once, then per-page items. After each batch: typecheck → lint → build → verify the live/rendered output. Tick each item in `SEO-AUDIT-PROGRESS.md` as you complete it.

### Phase 5 — Live signals (optional)  → `prompts/05-live-signals.md`
If the project has a live public URL **and** an MCP-connected SEO data tool is available (e.g. [RankParse](https://rankparse.com/docs/mcp)), sample a handful of pages and cross-check them against production: live Core Web Vitals, a live page-SEO scrape, and live sitemap coverage — the things a source-code audit structurally cannot see. Record findings in **`SEO-AUDIT-PROGRESS.md`** using `templates/live-signals.md`, filed into the existing Phase 3 backlog. If no live URL or MCP tool is available, skip this phase and say so.

## What "done" means

You are done when **all** of the following are true and you can show evidence for each:

- [ ] `ROUTES-INVENTORY.md` lists every route with a correct classification.
- [ ] `SEO-AUDIT-PROGRESS.md` has an audited + resolved row for every `public-index` page.
- [ ] Every `public-index` page has: unique title/description, self-referential canonical (+ hreflang if multilingual), correct `index,follow` robots, at least one type-appropriate JSON-LD block reflecting only visible content, exactly one `<h1>`, crawlable internal links, and server-rendered indexable content.
- [ ] Every `public-noindex` page emits `noindex` (and internal search results are excluded).
- [ ] Every `private` route is blocked in `robots.txt` and does not leak into the sitemap.
- [ ] The XML sitemap covers exactly the `public-index` set (no disallowed URLs), with accurate `lastmod`.
- [ ] Typecheck, lint, and build all pass. You have driven or rendered the changed routes and confirmed the output.
- [ ] Phase 5 was either run against a sample of live pages, or explicitly skipped with a stated reason (no live URL / no connected MCP SEO tool).
- [ ] A final **SEO Score** and **GEO Score** (`docs/11`) are reported, each with its category breakdown, coverage status (final vs. provisional), and the off-page-factors caveat — not a bare number.

Print a final summary table: page → what changed → verification evidence.

## If the user pasted only this file

Ask them to also give you the repo (or run you inside it), then start at **Phase 0**. If you already have the repo, **start now — Phase 0.**
